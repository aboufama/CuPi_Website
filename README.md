# CuPi Effects Website

This repo now ships a pared-down React + Vite experience focused on the compressor spin demo.

## Getting started

1. `npm install`
2. `npm install three @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei maath`
3. `npm run dev`

## Project structure

- `src/App.jsx` – renders the barebones layout and handles React Router navigation.
- `src/index.css` – minimal styling for the menu, scroll stage, and placeholders.
- `public/img/SpinAnimation.mp4` – video clip scrubbed via scroll.

Point your server at `index.html` (the Vite entry) to render the React experience.
